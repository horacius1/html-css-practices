<p><b>HTML</b> 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the <b>W3C</b> , as the <b>IETF</b> had closed its <b>HTML</b> <b>Working</b> <b>Group</b> on September 12, 1996.
â€‹Initially code-named "Wilbur", <b>HTML</b> 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary 
extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. <b><i>Netscape's blink</i></b> element and <b><i></i>Microsoft's</b> marquee element 
were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.</p>

 <p>A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in MathML.</p>
